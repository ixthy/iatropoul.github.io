Usage of Bootstrap
Bootstrap was used for a navigation bar at the top of the pages.

Usage of JavaScript
Javscript was used for the creation of trivia web pages.

When the users answers all the questions, a pop up window alert informs about the final score.
The code also makes sure that the questions will be answered only once, before giving the final score.
